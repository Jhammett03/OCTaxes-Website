            <h1> Todd Hammett, CPA</h1>
            <p>Todd has been a CPA for over 15 years. He graduated from Califormia State University Long Beach in 1984 with a Major in Accounting and Minor in Finance. Out of college, Todd worked for the prestigious accounting firm of Arthur Andersen & Co. as a Tax Manager for over seven years specializing in the Real Estate and High Technology industries and performed individual tax planning for some of Southern CA's most wealthy individuals. Since that time Todd has been a Chief Financial Officer for three growing technology companies and an investment and insurance consultant working with small business owners and families.
  
                More recently, Todd's emphasis has been as a generalist helping small business and individual clients with a wide range of consulting, planning, accounting, tax and QuickBooks issues. He enjoys the one-on-one aspect of getting to know each of his clients and helping them save money and plan for their futures.
                  
                Todd is married to his best friend and they have two children. He is an avid mountain biker, skiier and reader. One of Todd's favorite quotes is: "Work as if you were to live 100 years, pray as if you were to die tomorrow" - Ben Franklyn</p>
